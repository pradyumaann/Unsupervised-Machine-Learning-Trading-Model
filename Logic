The trading model is crafted to optimize a portfolio of S&P 500 stocks by integrating technical indicators, clustering, and portfolio optimization techniques. 
Initially, historical stock data is downloaded, and technical indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and ATR are computed. This data is then aggregated monthly, 
filtering the top 150 most liquid stocks based on dollar volume. The model calculates monthly returns for various time horizons and rolling factor betas using Fama-French 
factors to capture time-series dynamics and stock exposures.

K-means clustering is applied each month to group stocks into four clusters based on their features, particularly focusing on RSI values. The hypothesis was that the cluster 
with the highest RSI (Cluster 3) would outperform, but it was discovered that Cluster 1, centered around an RSI of 45, performed best. For each month, stocks are selected 
from these clusters, and the Efficient Frontier optimizer is used to form a portfolio aimed at maximizing the Sharpe ratio. The optimizer applies constraints to ensure 
diversification, preventing over-concentration in single stocks.

To validate the model, fresh daily prices for the selected stocks are downloaded, and daily returns for the portfolio are calculated and compared to the S&P 500 index. The 
cumulative returns are plotted to visualize the strategy's performance over time. This model leverages a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques 
to enhance portfolio selection and optimization.

Limitations - 
1. Assumption of Technical Indicators: The model heavily relies on technical indicators, which may not always predict future performance accurately.
2. Limited Scope of Data: The model only uses the S&P 500, which may not capture broader market trends.
3. Clustering Assumptions: The hypothesis about RSI and cluster performance did not hold, indicating potential flaws in the clustering approach or assumptions.
4. Overfitting Risk: Using historical data to optimize the portfolio may lead to overfitting, reducing the model's robustness in different market conditions.
5. Fixed Clusters: Using fixed initial centroids for K-means clustering may limit the modelâ€™s adaptability to changing market conditions.
